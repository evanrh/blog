Howdy!
I'm Evan Hastings, a full-stack engineer primarily working in React and Node.

At work, you can find me building usable systems with clean, simple deigns or helping to improve business process with software.
You can often find me tinkering and reading the docs as much as writing the code.

While I am not currently doing any work related to it, I take pride in educating folks on anything computer related from using spreadsheets to how various web frameworks work under the hood.
I have helped lead educative sessions at my work previously, and I am actively looking to improve my skills in this area.

I am an avid lover of all things networked, and I have a solid background in networking engineering and cybersecurity.
